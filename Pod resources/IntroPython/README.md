# ReproRehab: Introduction to Very First Time Programming in Python

This [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV4PTzGI0GjUw5yoPbsvjMKKSZtCc2FNa) is from the 2021 OT 699 course taught by Dr. Liew for occupational therapists with no previous experience with programming (e.g., had never written a line of code before, or even thought about writing a line of code before). These initial two weeks of content cover the basics of what is programming, terminology, and then dive into using Python (with Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook). By the end of the two weeks, learners will be able to write a basic commands and a function in python.

The materials used in these weeks can be found in this Github folder.

*As noted in the intro video, here at ReproRehab, we create content for each learner cohort. Since our 2022-2023 cohort did not have any learners interested in very beginner python, we decided to just provide this content in case it's useful for anyone. However, we anticipate additional content will be created for future learners as needed!

*In case people are interested, here is the [full OT 699 playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJSDUL80OPJ9viDc__qqBLgTzASdALcQO), which also includes very first time introductions to programming in Unity (a game engine), working with arduinos, 3D printing, and more.
